# Attendance Management System

## Problem Statement
Traditional attendance tracking methods, such as manual registers or paper-based systems, are inefficient, error-prone, and time-consuming. They often lead to inaccuracies, difficulties in generating reports, and challenges in monitoring attendance in real-time, especially in large organizations or educational institutions. This results in wasted administrative time, compliance issues, and hindered decision-making based on attendance data.

## Scope of the Project
This project will develop a web-based attendance management system focused on core functionalities for recording, tracking, and reporting attendance. It will include user authentication, attendance marking via various methods (e.g., self-service portals), and basic analytics. The scope excludes mobile app development, hardware integrations (e.g., biometric devices), and advanced AI features. Development will follow an agile approach over 4-6 months, with an MVP targeting essential features for small to medium-sized organizations.

## Target Users
- **Primary Users**: Administrators, teachers, and HR managers in schools, universities, and corporate offices who need to track and manage attendance for students or employees.
- **Secondary Users**: Event organizers and small business owners requiring attendance monitoring for meetings, workshops, or training sessions.
- **Key Demographics**: Professionals and educators aged 25-55, with access to computers and internet; users in educational and corporate sectors, particularly in urban and semi-urban areas.

## High-Level Features
- **User Registration and Profiles**: Secure account creation for users (e.g., students, employees) with role-based access (admin, user).
- **Attendance Marking**: Multiple input methods, including manual entry, QR code scanning, or self-check-in portals, with real-time updates.
- **Reporting and Analytics**: Generate customizable reports on attendance rates, absences, and trends, with export options (e.g., PDF, CSV).
- **Notifications and Alerts**: Automated alerts for absences, late arrivals, or upcoming deadlines via email or in-app notifications.
- **Dashboard and Monitoring**: Intuitive dashboards for viewing attendance data, with filters by date, user, or group.
- **Security and Compliance**: Data encryption, secure login (e.g., OAuth), and adherence to privacy standards like GDPR.
