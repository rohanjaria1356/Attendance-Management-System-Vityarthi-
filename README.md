# Attendance-Management-System-Vityarthi-
This project is a simple and interactive GUI-based Attendance Management System built using Python and Tkinter. It enables users to record a student’s Name, Roll Number, Attendance Status (Present/Absent) along with the current Date and Time. The system uses Tkinter’s Treeview widget to present attendance data in a structured table format.
